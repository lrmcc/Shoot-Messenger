# Shoot Messenger
### Status: Resumed development as of April 2022

## Description
This messaging application allows for users to launch a server for clients to connect to.
A server can exist on a local internet-connected machine. 
A client can connect to the server so long as the server's IP address is known.
The server will retain configuration and history in a locally.
Clients can view server configuration, which describes encryption use and dictates how long messages are held. 

## Usage
To allow for messaging platforms to exist temporarily or as needed. 

## Installation
Extract the app/build/distributions/app-<version>.zip then run the bin/app-<version> executable.
From there run a server before attempting to connect a client.

## Roadmap
- Refactor and shore up basic messaging
- Update server to retain data
- Add user friends/block features
