# Shoot
## An end-to-end encrypted messaging platform

### Description
- Shoot is an encrypted messaging platform comprised of server and client applications. The intent is for server instance operators to have complete control of messaging data beyond the reach of ISP or other entities.

- A server instance is hosted on a computer connected to the internet or in a local area network environment. Each running server can retain and load configuration and history locally. 

- Users are connected to a server by the server instance IP address and port via shoot client application.

### Installation
  1. Extract the app/build/distributions/app-<version>.zip then run the bin/app-<version> executable.
  2. From there launch a server before attempting to connect a client.

### Roadmap
  - Refactor and shore up basic messaging
  - Add encryption capabilities
  - Clarify useage over internet and LAN
  - Update server to retain and load data
  - User profile associated IP addressess record to retain/block
